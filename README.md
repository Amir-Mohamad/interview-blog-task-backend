# Project Documentation: Base

## Purpose
The **Base** project is a pre-configured Django template designed to streamline the development process by providing a foundational structure with essential settings, apps, and URLs. This eliminates the need for manual setup and allows developers to focus on building their specific applications.

## Features

  
- **Basic URL Structure:** Provides a basic URL structure with a root URL pattern to get you started.

- **Settings Configuration:** Contains a sample settings file with default values for common settings:
  - Database configuration
  - Static file settings

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amir-Mohamad/base.git base
   ```
   *Use code with caution.*

2. **Install Requirements:**
   ```bash
   cd base
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Use code with caution.*



3. **Add Your App to `INSTALLED_APPS`:**
   In your project's `settings.py`, add your app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ... other apps
       'your_app_name',
   ]
   ```
   *Use code with caution.*

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   *Use code with caution.*

## Additional Notes

- **Version Control:** Use Git or another version control system to track changes to your project.
- **Documentation:** Consider adding more detailed documentation to your project, including explanations of how to use specific features or customize the base project.
